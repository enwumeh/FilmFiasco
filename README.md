## Project Name

FilmFiasco

## Project Description

I will be using the Moviedb API to create a page that displays a range of movies. I plan on having link options for the user to access popular movies and recent releases. You can also search movies by title through a search bar. I plan to have a link for each movie to check out a trailer
